\section{Metrics from the Literature}

\subsection{Proportion of Items}
\textbf{Source: }Ferrante et al 2015 \cite{ferrante:PLoSCB:2015} \\\\
\textbf{Description: } "Proportion of items retrieved by more than one [agent] over the total number of items retrieved".\\\\
\textbf{Formula: }\\
%
\[
\frac{R_{cooperative}}{R_{total}}
\]
where:
\begin{description}
\item[$R_{cooperative}$] is Resources retrieved by more than one agent
\item[$R_{total}$] is Total resources retrieved by the team
\end{description}
%
\textbf{Pros:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Simple
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Cons:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Agents can pick up and drop resources without contributing to their transportation e.g. Go to source, pick up and drop on the spot, transport another resource as a generalist.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Thoughts:}\\
It's too easy for non-specialist strategies to look like specialisation.
I think this metric should be avoided if possible.

\subsection{Action Switching}

\subsubsection{Frequency of Action Switches}
\textbf{Source: } Nitschke et al 2012 \cite{nitschke:SEC:2012} \\\\
\textbf{Description: } "The frequency with which the controller switches between executing distinct motor outputs (actions) during its lifetime".\\\\
\textbf{Formula: }\\
%
\[
\frac{A}{N}
\]
%
where:
\begin{description}
\item[$A$] is Action switches over an episode
\item[$N$] is Number of possible switches over an episode
\end{description}
\textbf{Pros:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Calculates an agent's specialisation rather than a team's. Can identify non-specialists on a team.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Cons:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Only works if the dropper and collector strategies could be executed with just one action.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Thoughts:}\\
This could be good if there's a way to adapt it to slope foraging.
Maybe something like number of area switches?
A pure collector shouldn't leave the nest and cache and a pure dropper shouldn't leave the source/slope.
But then, what if a dropper goes all the way down the slope before dropping?
Is it just an inefficient specialist?
What if a dropper and collector display perfect specialisation,  swap roles mid-episode, then continue displaying perfect specialisation with the reversed roles?

\subsubsection{Complement of action changes}

\textbf{Source: } Gautrais et al 2002 \cite{gautrais:JTB:2002} \\\\
\textbf{Description: } Complement of the frequency of an individual changing tasks\\\\
\textbf{Formula: }\\
%
\[
F_{i} = 1 - 2 C_{i}
\]
%
where:
\begin{description}
\item[$i$] is the index of the individual
\item[$F_{i}$] is the degree of specialisation
\item[$C_{i}$] is the number of action changes divided by the number of action steps in an episode. 0 is generalist, 1 is specialist.
\end{description}
\textbf{Pros:}
\begin{itemize}
\item 
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Cons:}
\begin{itemize}
\item 
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Thoughts:} Specialisation of an individual. Not sure if that's what we want.\\

\subsection{Entropy}

\subsubsection{Correlation with Diversity}

\textbf{Source: Li et al \cite{li:AB:2004}} \\\\
\textbf{Description: The correlation coefficient between diversity and swarm performance.
Diversity is calculated by running a clustering algorithm on the genomes and calculating the entropy.} \\\\
\textbf{Formula: }\\
%
\[
S = corrcoef(D;R) \times D
\]
%
where:
\begin{description}
\item[$D$] is Diversity, measured using entropy
\item[$R$] is Team performance
\end{description}
\textbf{Pros:}
\begin{itemize}
\item General
\item Based on analysis of metrics in the literature (as at 2004)
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Cons:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Complicated. 
\item Computationally expensive? Have to run a clustering algorithm each time.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Thoughts:} I don't fully understand the diversity measure. 
I don't think you can apply clustering in slope foraging.
Intentionally decides that specialisation is a team measure not an individual one.
Intentionally decides that teams are only specialised when they perform well, otherwise it is just diversity.

\subsubsection{Entropy of activity}

\textbf{Source: }O'Donnell et al 1990 \cite{odonnell:BES:1990} \\\\
\textbf{Description: }Entropy of an agent's focus on different materials being foraged. Low entropy means an agent is specialised because it focuses on less activities.\\\\
\textbf{Formula: }\\
%
\[
H(x)=- \sum  p(x)\log_{2}p(x)
\]
%
where:
\begin{description}
\item[$p(x)$] is the proportion a forager's effort devoted to a given material($x$)
\end{description}
\textbf{Pros:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Has theoretical underpinning
\item Generalisable
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Cons:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Requires the high level a priori knowledge of what each activity/sub-task is
\item An individual that does one task and then switches half-way is the same as one that alternates throughout
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Thoughts:}\\

\subsection{Other}

\subsubsection{Counting actions}

\textbf{Source: } Pini et al 2011 \cite{pini:SI:2011}\\\\
\textbf{Description: } Count the number of times agents chose to use the corridor (i.e. slope) vs the cache and use that in a bar graph to show which strategies partition (i.e. specialise) vs not. \\\\
\textbf{Formula: }\\
N/A
\\\\
\textbf{Pros:}
\begin{itemize}
\item 
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Cons:}
\begin{itemize}
\item 
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Thoughts:} You could turn this into a metric. Number of times an agent went onto the slope? But doesn't quite work because in the Pini version, a specialist only ever needs to touch the 'slope' once, whereas in mine a dropper has to go on it every time it drops. \\

\subsubsection{Time spent changing role}

\textbf{Source: } Gigliotta et al 2018 \cite{gigliotta:Neurocomputing:2018} \\\\
\textbf{Description: } Not a metric. But count the number of time steps spent changing roles as an indicator of specialisation.\\\\
\textbf{Formula: }\\
N/A
\\\\
\textbf{Pros:}
\begin{itemize}
\item 
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Cons:}
\begin{itemize}
\item 
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Thoughts:}\\

\section{Metrics by Me}

\begin{itemize}
\item Number of area transitions
\item Number of slope-to-cache and cache-to-slope transitions
\item Time spent on slope
\end{itemize}

\section{Thoughts on Specialisation}

How do I define specialisation, verbally?
Is there a way to define specialisation that is not unique to this application?
Is an agent specialised or is a team?
An agent is specialised if they perform a behaviour that cannot complete the task alone.
Does specialisation have to be successful?
What if an agent performs a behaviour that can't complete the task but is unproductive?
If specialisation is only specialisation when it succeeds, doesn't that bias the results?
